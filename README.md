# Spectral Transformer

The **Spectral Transformer** repository demonstrates the versatility of transformer-based AI models in signal processing tasks, with a particular focus on **audio applications** like noise suppression. Unlike traditional transformer inputs consisting of tokenized text, this project adapts modern transformer architectures to work directly with **audio signals** represented as mel-spectrograms. The transformers are customized to accommodate this unique input format, enabling highly effective signal analysis and modification.

A key highlight is the integration of neural networks and digital signal processing (DSP) techniques. The results showcase the synergy of these approaches, achieving precise noise suppression while maintaining the **original signal's phase information**. Notably, this approach avoids the use of [vocoders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_vocoder) for audio reconstruction, ensuring higher fidelity in the output.

## Results

Even with a relatively simple transformer network, excellent performance can be achieved in real-world scenarios, as illustrated by the following example. Using the challenging task of separating human speech from background noise (e.g., frog sounds), the network demonstrates its robustness. Specifically:

## Transformer

This section presents a textbook description of the Transformer, which may be skipped by those already familiar with the concept. It provides a matrix representation aligned with the Julia format, where inputs are arranged as $inputs \times sequence$, unlike formats used in the [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/html/1706.03762v7) paper. Additionally, it lays the groundwork for modifications needed to handle audio data instead of text, with the implementation following this structure.


### Attention Head

The attention mechanism is a foundational concept in modern deep learning architectures, such as the Transformer. It enables models to focus on specific elements of an input sequence when generating an output, capturing the relationships between elements of the sequence. This section provides a step-by-step explanation of how the attention mechanism operates for **a single attention head**, starting with input representation as matrices, followed by transformations into **queries (Q)**, **keys (K)**, and **values (V)**â€”all of which are *learned* representations rather than direct input data. The similarities between **Q** and **K** are then measured using a dot product, yielding weights that indicate how relevant each position is relative to the current query. These weights are subsequently applied to **V**, allowing the model to focus on and aggregate information from different parts of the sequence. Each step is described in terms of the matrix operations that underlie the mechanism.

#### 1. Input Representation as a Matrix

The input sequence is represented as a matrix:

Let the sequence have $n$ elements, each represented by a vector of dimension $d$. The input sequence to the attention head is then represented as:

$$
X \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}
$$

where **each column corresponds to the representation of an element in the sequence**.

#### 2. Linear Transformations to Obtain Query, Key, and Value

Each element of the input sequence is transformed into three separate representations: **query ($Q$)**, **key ($K$)**, and **value ($V$)** using weight matrices:

$$
Q = W_Q X \quad \text{where} \quad W_Q \in \mathbb{R}^{d_k \times d}
$$

$$
K = W_K X \quad \text{where} \quad W_K \in \mathbb{R}^{d_k \times d}
$$

$$
V = W_V X \quad \text{where} \quad W_V \in \mathbb{R}^{d_v \times d}
$$

Here:
- $d_k$ is the dimension of the query and key vectors.  
- $d_v$ is the dimension of the value vectors.


The weight matrices $W\_Q$, $W\_K$, and $W\_V$ are trained during the learning process, with each attention head independently learning its own set of weights. Each element in the input sequence is linearly mapped into a column in $Q$, $K$, and $V$.

After the transformations:
- $Q \in \mathbb{R}^{d_k \times n}$,
- $K \in \mathbb{R}^{d_k \times n}$,
- $V \in \mathbb{R}^{d_v \times n}$.

#### 3. Attention Score Calculation

The attention mechanism determines the relevance of each element in the sequence to every other element. This is done by computing a **similarity** score between queries and keys using a [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product):

$$
\text{Attention Score} = K^T Q
$$

Where:
- $Q \in \mathbb{R}^{d_k \times n}$ (queries from all elements),
- $K^T \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_k}$ (keys transposed).

The result is:

$$
S \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}
$$

where $S_{ij}$ represents the relevance of the $j$-th element to the $i$-th element.

To stabilize training and avoid overly large values, these scores are scaled by $\sqrt{d_k}$:

$$
\text{Scaled Attention Score} = \frac{K^T Q}{\sqrt{d_k}}
$$

#### 4. Softmax to Compute Attention Weights

The [softmax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softmax_function) function is applied column-wise to the scaled attention scores to produce attention weights, ensuring that each column forms a probability distribution that sums to 1:

$$
A = \text{Softmax}\left(\frac{K^T Q}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)
$$

For the $i$-th query, the attention weight for the $j$-th key is:

$$
A_{ij} = \frac{\exp(S_{ij})}{\sum_{k=1}^n \exp(S_{kj})}
$$

This produces the attention weight matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$, where each element $A_{ij}$ quantifies the contribution of the $j$-th key to the $i$-th query.

#### 5. Weighted Sum Using Values

The attention weights are used to compute a weighted sum of the value vectors:

$$
\text{Output} = V A
$$

Where:
- $V \in \mathbb{R}^{d_v \times n}$ (value representations),
- $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ (attention weights).

The result is:

$$
O \in \mathbb{R}^{d_v \times n}
$$

which is the output of the attention mechanism.

### Explanation Summary

The attention mechanism identifies and amplifies important relationships between sequence elements. Each column in $V$ represents an abstract [embedding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_embedding) of an element in the input to the attention head. The $j$-th column of $A$ represents the weighting of these embeddings for calculating the $j$-th element in the output, with the $i$-th element representing the weight of the $i$-th column in $V$.

The weight matrices $W_Q$, $W_K$, and $W_V$ are learned during training and independently map each input element (each column in $X$) to corresponding columns in the query, key, and value matrices. This independent transformation allows the model to capture the necessary relationships for effective task performance.

Even though the explanation focuses on the sequential nature of the inputs, it is important to emphasize that the primary motivation behind this architecture is to enable parallel processing. In other words, the entire input sequence is processed simultaneously within the attention head. 

---

## Multi-Head Attention Mechanism

Multi-head attention employs multiple attention "heads" operating in parallel, with each head focusing on different aspects of the input by independently computing attention outputs using its own learned weight matrices. This allows the model to capture a diverse range of features and relationships, resulting in richer input representations.

### Parallel Attention Heads and Matrix Combination

Each of the $h$ attention heads computes an output matrix:

$$
O_i = V_i A_i \quad \text{for } i = 1, 2, \dots, h,
$$

where $O_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d_v \times n}$ is the output of the $i$-th head. The outputs from all heads are stacked vertically to form a single matrix:

$$
O_{\text{MultiHead}} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
O_1 \\
O_2 \\
\vdots \\
O_h
\end{bmatrix} 
\in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}.
$$

This stacking yields a unified matrix where each head contributes distinct features. The combined output adheres to the convention of having $d$ rows, enforcing the constraint $h \cdot d_v = d$.

---

## Attention Layer
The Transformer architecture, introduced in the paper [*Attention Is All You Need*](https://arxiv.org/html/1706.03762v7) (Vaswani et al., 2017), is built around the multi-head self-attention mechanism, supported by feed-forward layers and add and norm operations. This section focuses on these **support layers**, which, as shown in the architecture diagram below. 

![Transformer architecture](https://arxiv.org/html/1706.03762v7/extracted/1706.03762v7/Figures/ModalNet-21.png)

The feed-forward layer increases the dimension to $d\_\text{ffn}$ (typically $4d$), which enables the model to capture richer and more complex features in a higher-dimensional space. Subsequently, the dimension is reduced back to $d$, ensuring the output remains manageable and compatible with the rest of the architecture, while still benefiting from the complex intermediate representations. Using [ReLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)) as the [activation function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function) in the layer, this can be described as:

$$
\text{FeedForwardLayer}(X) = W_2 (\text{ReLU}(W_1 X + b_1)) + b_2
$$

where $W_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{d\_\text{ffn} \times d}$, $b_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{d\_\text{ffn}}$, $W_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d\_\text{ffn}}$, and $b_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{d}$.

To improve gradient flow, attention layers also apply [residual connections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_neural_network). These signals are added to the processed signals, and the results are normalized to stabilize the gradients. Introducing the function [Normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_(machine_learning)) that take an input in $\mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$, we can write the processing in an attention layer as:

$$
\text{MultiHeadAttentionWithResidual}(X)=\text{Normalize}(X+\text{MultiHeadAttention}(X))
$$

$$
\text{FeedForwardWithResidual}(X)=\text{Normalize}(X+\text{FeedForwardLayer}(X))
$$

$$
\text{AttentionLayer}=\text{FeedForwardWithResidual} \circ \text{MultiHeadAttentionWithResidual}
$$

---

## Transformer Block

The system considered here is an **encoder**, composed of $N$ stacked **Transformer attention layers**, each integrating multi-head attention, feed-forward layers, and add and norm operations. These layers process input sequences into high-dimensional representations.

The original Transformer architecture, as introduced in [*Attention Is All You Need*](https://arxiv.org/html/1706.03762v7), included both an encoder and a decoder:

1. **Encoder**:
   - Processes input sequences into high-dimensional representations.
   - Fully parallelizable, making it efficient for non-generative tasks.

2. **Decoder**:
   - Generates output sequences token by token, attending to both encoder outputs and previously generated tokens.
   - Requires an **attention mask** during training to prevent "looking ahead."

While encoder-decoder configurations are used for tasks like translation and summarization (e.g., **BART**), encoder-only systems simplify training and are ideal for tasks such as classification and sound processing. Decoder-only models, like **ChatGPT**, focus on text generation.

---

### Example: Instantiating an Encoder Block in Julia

Using [Transformers.jl](https://github.com/chengchingwen/Transformers.jl):

```julia
using Transformers

# Instantiate an encoder block
transformer_block = TransformerBlock(
    model_dim = 512,       # Model dimension (d)
    num_heads = 8,         # Attention heads
    ffn_dim = 2048,        # Feed-forward dimension (d_ffn)
    num_layers = 6         # Number of layers (N)
)
```

Frameworks like [Transformers.jl](https://github.com/chengchingwen/Transformers.jl) provide modular implementations, enabling easy customization of encoder blocks. This example demonstrates how to set up a stack of $N$ attention layers for encoder-based tasks.

## Input and Output Embedding for Audio in the Frequency Domain

In our **noise suppression** application, we operate on **audio signals in the frequency domain** using a matrix $U \in \mathbb{R}^{d_U \times n}$, where:

- $d_U$ is the **feature dimension** (e.g., mel-frequency bins),
- $n$ is the **sequence length** (e.g., number of time frames).

### Input Embedding

Before passing $U$ into the Transformer, we apply an **Input Embedding** step that projects $U$ to the modelâ€™s embedding dimension $d$ using a linear layer:

$$\text{Embedding}(U) = W_{\text{emb}} U,$$

where $W_{\text{emb}} \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d_U}$. Thus,

$$\text{Embedding}(U) \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}.$$

Each column of $\text{Embedding}(U)$ represents a sequence element, enabling the Transformer to process the audio data effectively.

### Output Projection

After the Transformer processes the embedded features, we convert the output back to the original audio feature space through an **Output Projection** step, implemented as another linear layer:

$$\text{OutputProjection}(Y) = W_{\text{out}} Y,$$

where $W_{\text{out}} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_U \times d}$ and $Y \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$. Consequently,

$$\text{OutputProjection}(Y) \in \mathbb{R}^{d_U \times n}.$$

Both the **Input Embedding** matrix $W_{\text{emb}}$ and the **Output Projection** matrix $W_{\text{out}}$ are **learned independently** during training. There is **no enforced relationship** between them, allowing each to optimize its transformation for its specific role:

---

## Positional Encoding

Without explicit positional information, the model sees only a set of token embeddings, with no inherent way to determine their order in the sequence. This means the model would need to learn the relationships between neighboring tokens solely from the data, without knowing which tokens are adjacent. Since this approach is inefficient, positional embeddings are introduced to provide the model with information about token positions.

### Definition of PE

The positional encoding $\text{PE}(i, j)$ is defined for each embedding dimension $i$ and token position $j$ as:

$$
\text{PE}(i, j) =
\begin{cases}
\sin\left(\frac{j}{10000^{i/d}}\right), & \text{if } i \text{ is even}, \\
\cos\left(\frac{j}{10000^{(i-1)/d}}\right), & \text{if } i \text{ is odd}.
\end{cases}
$$

Here:
- $j$ is the token's position in the sequence.
- $i$ is the embedding dimension index.
- $d$ is the embedding dimensionality.

This creates a matrix $\mathbf{P}$ where each column represents a tokenâ€™s positional encoding. The matrix is visualized below, showing that the embedding for the first position oscillates with a very high frequency, while the frequency decreases for larger positions.

![positional encoding](figures/position.png)

If we multiply the embeddings of two different positions and plot the resulting $sequence \times sequence$ matrix, the following pattern emerges:

![distance](figures/distance.png)

The raw dot product between two positional encodings defines a function that measures the relative distance between the two positions. Since the attention mechanism involves a dot product between $K^T$ and $Q$, it *can* capture the relative distance between inputs in the sequence. The term *can* is used because this process also involves multiplication with learned weights, allowing the model to adjust these weights during training to capture embedded data, relative or absolute position, or a combination of both.

---

### Dot product of positional Embeddings

#### 1. Column Construction (Position as Column Index)

To understand the mechanism behind this, assume the positional encoding matrix $\mathbf{P}$ has:
- **$d$ rows** (each row corresponds to a dimension of the embedding),
- **$n$ columns** (each column corresponds to a position $j$ in the sequence).

For position $j$, the column $\mathbf{p}\_j$ looks like

$$\mathbf{p}\_j = \bigl[\sin\bigl(\tfrac{j}{\alpha\_0}\bigr),\,\cos\bigl(\tfrac{j}{\alpha\_0}\bigr),\,\sin\bigl(\tfrac{j}{\alpha\_1}\bigr),\,\cos\bigl(\tfrac{j}{\alpha\_1}\bigr),\,\dots\bigr]^\top$$

where each $\alpha\_k$ (often $10000^{k/d}$) controls the wavelength of the $k$-th sine/cosine pair.

#### 2. Dot Product Involves Sine-Cosine Products

To compute the dot product between two columns $\mathbf{p}\_j$ and $\mathbf{p}\_{j'}$ (positions $j$ and $j'$), we pairwise multiply elements and sum them:

$$\mathbf{p}\_j^\top\mathbf{p}\_{j'} = \sum_{k\in\text{(sine/cos pairs)}}\bigl[\sin\bigl(\tfrac{j}{\alpha\_k}\bigr)\sin\bigl(\tfrac{j'}{\alpha\_k}\bigr) + \cos\bigl(\tfrac{j}{\alpha\_k}\bigr)\cos\bigl(\tfrac{j'}{\alpha\_k}\bigr)\bigr].$$

Using the trigonometric identity

$$\sin(A)\sin(B)+\cos(A)\cos(B)=\cos(A-B),$$

each sine-cosine pair becomes

$$\cos\bigl(\tfrac{j}{\alpha\_k}-\tfrac{j'}{\alpha\_k}\bigr)=\cos\Bigl(\tfrac{j-j'}{\alpha\_k}\Bigr).$$

#### 3. Dependence on $(j-j')$

Summing across all frequencies $\alpha\_k$ yields terms of the form $\cos\bigl(\tfrac{j-j'}{\alpha\_k}\bigr)$. Hence, the dot product depends on the difference $(j-j')$:

$$\mathbf{p}\_j \mathbf{p}\_{j'} = \sum_{k}\cos\Bigl(\frac{j-j'}{\alpha\_k}\Bigr).$$

Because this expression depends only on $(j-j')$ and **not** on $j$ or $j'$ separately, it encodes the **relative distance** between these two positions in the sequence.

---

### Masking in the Encoder

In Transformer architectures, **masking** controls the flow of information during training. Within the **encoder**, masks primarily address varying sequence lengths and enforce causality, similar to their role in the **decoder**.

#### Purpose of Masking

1. **Handling Variable Sequence Lengths:**  
   Masks prevent the encoder from attending to padding tokens, ensuring that attention mechanisms focus only on meaningful data.

2. **Enforcing Causality:**  
   Masks restrict attention to previous positions in the sequence, maintaining the temporal order and preventing the model from accessing future information during training.

#### Current Application Context

In our **noise suppression** application, all input sequences have a **constant length**, eliminating the immediate need for masking. However, we retain the masking mechanism to support potential future enhancements, such as:

- **Variable-Length Inputs:** Allowing the model to handle audio samples of different duration's without structural changes.
- **Enhanced Feature Integration:** Facilitating the inclusion of additional features that may require selective attention controls.

By maintaining the masking infrastructure, we ensure that the model remains flexible and adaptable to evolving requirements, even though masking is not strictly necessary for the current fixed-length sequence setup.

---

### Model Summary

The **Spectral Transformer** suppresses audio noise through the following pipeline:

1. **Embedding and Positional Encoding**  
$$X=\text{PositionalEncoding}(\text{Embedding}(U))$$

2. **Transformer Processing and Output Projection**  
$$Y=\text{OutputProjection}(\text{Transformer}(X))$$

The corresponding model definition from the implementation is shown below:

```julia
struct Model
    position_embedding
    projection
    withmask 
    transformer
    antiprojection
end
 
model = Model(position_embedding, projection_layer, withmask, encoding_transformer, antiprojection_layer)
@functor Model (projection, transformer, antiprojection)

function (model::Model)(input)
    position = model.position_embedding(input.hidden_state)
    projection = model.projection(input.hidden_state)
    transformed = model.transformer((hidden_state = projection .+ position, attention_mask = input.attention_mask))
    result = (hidden_state = model.antiprojection(transformed.hidden_state), attention_mask = transformed.attention_mask)
    return result
end
```

Within the **Transformer.jl** framework, signals between blocks are represented as tuples. Specifically, the framework uses a `hidden_state` field to represent the actual data and an `attention_mask`. In this application, masking is included to support future enhancements, such as handling variable-length inputs.

The `@functor` macro is used in this framework to expose learnable weights for automatic differentiation during training.

## Audio Signal Processing

Before feeding raw audio signals into the **Spectral Transformer**, they undergo a carefully designed signal processing pipeline. Each step in this pipeline is tailored to enhance the quality of the data and improve the neural network's performance. By addressing different aspects of the audio signal, these preprocessing steps ensure that the transformer operates on meaningful, well-structured data. The following sections describe each step and its purpose in preparing the signal for effective noise suppression.

---

### Short-Time Fourier Transform

The first step involves applying the [Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-time_Fourier_transform) to convert the audio signal from the time domain to a sequence of Short Fourier Transforms. This is done using an [FFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) length of $d_U$ and a modified [Hanning window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hann_function):

$$h(k) = \sin^2\left(\frac{\pi k}{d_U}\right), \quad k \in [1 \dots d_U]$$

Although the first element of this window is not zero, it is still effective due to its smooth tapering, which minimizes spectral leakage. Overlapping windows (with a step size of $\frac{d_U}{2}$) ensure continuity, as the peak value (1) of one window aligns with the zero value of the previous, and the sum of overlapping window values is always 1. This simplifies signal reconstruction (see **Signal Reconstruction** for details).

The resulting STFT is given by:

$$X_{\mathbb{C}} = \text{stft}(u_{audio}, h, \text{step} = \frac{d_U}{2})$$

Here, the subscript $\mathbb{C}$ indicates that the resulting matrix is complex, containing both amplitude and phase information in the frequency domain. For a real input signal, the STFT returns the [DC component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_bias), positive frequencies, and the [Nyquist frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyquist_frequency), since negative frequencies are the complex conjugates of positive ones.

---

### Spectrogram

Since the transformer operates in the power domain, $X_{\mathbb{C}}$ is converted to a spectrogram by taking the squared magnitude of each element:

$$X_{P} = \text{spectrogram}(X_{\mathbb{C}})$$

Some scaling is applied during this process, depending on the data dimensions, but this is not critical due to subsequent normalization steps.

---

### Mel Representation

Human perception is more sensitive to variations in lower frequencies, which allows for reducing the dimensionality of data using a [Mel-frequency scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum). In this application, only the Mel filtering step is applied, omitting the [Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform).

This step involves a straightforward linear transformation:

$$X_M = dB(M \times X_P), \quad M \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times d_U}, \quad X_M \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$$

A code snippet for constructing the Mel filter matrix $M$ can be found at [Practical Cryptography](http://practicalcryptography.com/miscellaneous/machine-learning/guide-mel-frequency-cepstral-coefficients-mfccs/) and can be easily adapted to Julia. The figure below illustrates the structure of the matrix $M$. Each graph corresponds to one row in $M$, with the axes representing the frequency bins and their respective weights in the summarization performed by the multiplication with $M$.

![MEL filter bank](figures/mel_bank.png)

The following observations can be made:

1. The lowest frequencies outside the human voice spectrum are ignored.
2. The overlapping graphs have weights that sum to one, ensuring no energy loss within the Mel spectrum.
3. The width of the triangular graphs increases for higher frequencies due to the Mel scale construction.

The function [dB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decibel) converts the power level to a logarithmic scale by applying:

$$dB(P) = 10 \log_{10}(P)$$

to each element in the matrix. This results in a double logarithmic representation.

---

### Power clamping

One issue with the logarithmic representation is that low power levels, which do not significantly contribute to the audio signal, are represented as large negative numbers. This can affect the training process, as the network may focus on these irrelevant values instead of the meaningful parts of the signal. To address this, the signal is clamped above a threshold, defined as the maximum power level of the signal or noise attenuated by 60 dB.

---

### Whitening

The final step before feeding the data to the model is **whitening**, which normalizes the signal by setting its mean to zero and standard deviation to one. This ensures consistent input statistics, improving training stability and convergence. The stored bias and scaling factors are later used to reverse the transformation on the modelâ€™s output, allowing correct reconstruction of the enhanced audio.

Whitening helps reduce bias from background noise and enhances model generalization by ensuring the network focuses on patterns rather than variations in magnitude. This step is crucial for reliable performance across diverse audio signals.

$$U=whiten(clamp(X_M))$$

## Audio Signal Reconstruction

Audio signal reconstruction is, in many ways, similar to audio processing but performed in the reverse order. However, several challenges remain, primarily because the transformer operates on data in the power domain, while an audio signal in the frequency domain is defined by both amplitude and phase. Additionally, the MEL spectral bank applies dimensionality reduction, which leads to a loss of information.

---

### Anti-Whitening

The scaling factors used during signal whitening were stored. In the anti-whitening process, these stored scaling factors are applied in reverse to restore the original signal scale.

### Anti-dB

The next step involves converting the signal representation from the logarithmic dB scale back to the power domain by applying the inverse transformation:

$$\text{antidB}(dB)=10^{\frac{dB}{10}}$$

### Attenuation

For each column $u\_P$ in $U\_P$, we aim to define an attenuation that can be applied to each element of $u\_P$. The attenuated version of $u\_P$ should yield the same power output during audio processing as the corresponding output $y$ from the transformer model, where $y$ is the column in $Y$ corresponding to $u\_P$.

Inspection of $M$ shows that it contains all-zero rows, meaning that multiplying any vector by $M$ results in a non-regular system of equations. To address this, we first define a modified version of $M$ that excludes zero rows. We introduce the function $\text{RegularRows}(M)$, which removes all-zero rows from $M$. This function is extended to $\text{RegularRows}(u\_P, M)$, which removes corresponding rows in $u\_P$ that align with the zero rows in $M$.

$$\tilde{M}=\text{RegularRows}(M),\quad \tilde{M}\in\mathbb{R}^{\tilde{m}\times n}$$

$$\tilde{u}\_P=\text{RegularRows}(u\_P, M),\quad \tilde{u}\_P\in\mathbb{R}^{\tilde{m}}$$

where $\tilde{m}$ represents the number of non-zero rows in $M$.

Next, we introduce $w\in\mathbb{R}^{\tilde{m}}$, where $\tilde{M}\cdot w$ represents the desired attenuation. The relationship is expressed as:

$$y=\tilde{M}\cdot \text{Diagonal}(\tilde{M}^{T}w)\cdot \tilde{u}\_P$$

Here, $\text{Diagonal}(\tilde{M}^{T} w)$ represents an attenuation applied to the vector $\tilde{u}\_P$. Since $U\_P$ represents power, this equation ensures that the attenuated version maintains the same power output. This can be rewritten as a linear system:

$$y=\tilde{M}\cdot \text{Diagonal}(\tilde{M}^{T} \cdot \tilde{u}\_P)\cdot w$$

From $w$, we can derive the attenuation we are seeking:

$$\text{PowerAttenuation}=\text{ReconstructRows}(clamp(\tilde{M}^{T} w,0,1), M)$$

Finally, we must account for the zero rows that were removed from $M$. To do this, we define the function $\text{ReconstructRows}(\tilde{u}\_P, M)$, which reinserts zeros at the positions of the discarded rows in $\tilde{u}\_P$. The reconstructed signal, representing the attenuated power, can then be written as:

$$
attenuation=[\sqrt{PowerAttenuation_{i,j}}]
$$

Where the square root is applied element wise.

The attenuation is then applied to the corresponding column of $X_{\mathbb{C}}$ to create $Y_{\mathbb{C}}$.

The audio output signal is then created as:

$$
y_{audio}=antisftf(Y_{\mathbb{C}}, step=\frac{d_U}{2})
$$

Where $antisftr$ simply convert each $fft$ back into the time domain and add overlapping audio segment to reconstruct the cleaned audio signal.

## Data

The speech data are taken from the [fluent-speech-corpus](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tommyngx/fluent-speech-corpus?resource=download). This dataset consists of several speakers pronouncing a set of fixed commands. The speaker ID `7B4XmNppyrCK977p` was selected, and all sentences from this speaker were loaded. Sentences shorter than 2 seconds were discarded.

Noise samples are frog sounds taken from the [Environmental Sound Classification 50](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mmoreaux/environmental-sound-classification-50) dataset, which contains samples of various environmental sounds with a fixed duration of 5 seconds.

At this point, the samples are split into 10% [out-of-sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)) data for verification and 90% [in-sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics)) data for training. Both sets undergo the same processing pipeline.

All data are [sample-rate converted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample-rate_conversion) to a common sample rate of \( f_s = 8192 \text{ Hz} \).

The volume of the samples is set by first applying an \( \alpha \)-filter with adjustable attack/decay time to the Hilbert transform of the data, defining the [envelope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope_(music)) of the signal. The signal is then amplified or attenuated so that the maximum value of the envelope reaches a fixed level. This level is consistent across both noise and speech signals.

Each noise sample, originally 5 seconds long, is divided into three overlapping parts, each with a duration of 2 seconds.

Finally, the training and validation datasets are created by mixing the frog noise samples with the speech signals in their respective datasets.

## training

### Training Loop Description:

The training loop iterates over multiple epochs, where in each epoch it processes all samples in the training set. For each sample, a function (`withmask`) is applied to combine the input data and corresponding mask into the required format for the transformer model. The model's gradients are computed using automatic differentiation, and the parameters are updated accordingly with an optimization algorithm. After each epoch, the model's performance is evaluated on both in-sample and out-of-sample test sets, and the resulting losses are recorded. Progress is logged throughout the process.

```julia
optimizerstate = Flux.setup(Adam(1e-4), model)
epochs=1:10

function train!()
    @info "start training"
    global losses
    for epoch in epochs
        @showprogress for (i,sample) in enumerate(train)
            input=withmask(sample)
            Ïµ,âˆ‡=Flux.withgradient(model, input) do m, s
                loss(m, s)
            end
            Flux.update!(optimizerstate, model, âˆ‡[1])             
        end
        ls=[dataloaderloss(test.is) dataloaderloss(test.oos)]
        println("$epoch: $ls")
        losses=vcat(losses,ls)
    end
end
 
@time train!()
